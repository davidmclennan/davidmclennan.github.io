I love to work on game development as a hobby and have been doing so since my last year of university in 2014 where my bachelor's thesis was to develop a mobile game in Unity. After graduating I kept up development of arcade style mobile games, examples of which can be found on my YouTube channel.

Later I shifted focus towards more ambitious 3D PC projects after teaching myself the basics of Blender, examples of which can be found in private github repos upon request. For my latest project I have decided to experiment with Godot.
