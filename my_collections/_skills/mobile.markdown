I have had 4 years of .NET mobile development experience using Xamarin.Forms. Through this technology I have delivered many different cross-platform Android and iOS apps to many different clients.

I have experience working with vanilla Xamarin and with MVVM frameworks, the Prism framework being my most used and preferred way of working with Xamarin.
